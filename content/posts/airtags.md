I've been listening to [Michael Bazzell's podcast](https://inteltechniques.com/podcast.html) and he mentioned using AirTags to spy on people. Is this possible?

I think AirTags use the same network as find my iphone, so if you slip one into a bag it'll keep updating and saying where it is. This might even mean telling when someone is home or not. If the tag stops updating, the person might have left the house with their phone.

I guess the only way to know is to test it. I'll ask my friends and see if they want to volunteer to have one in their backpacks.
