+++

This past July the Xbox 360 store was closed. It was sad but inevitable. I don't know anyone who still plays on the 360 and the majority of old games I play are backwards compatible with my Xbox Series X or on steam.

Still, there are games that are forever trapped on the 360. Whether it was exclusive or it was the best version of the game (includes content missing from future versions). All the games I bought were on a big discount. Some can be played on other systems or steam, but I felt they were best on the 360.

I couldn't fit all the games I bought and the ones I owned already on my xbox. I had to buy an external hard drive and move all games from the internal drive over. Since the download speeds are slow and the marketplace was already glitching out with the life support it was on, I didn't start downloading until I was finished buying games. Then, I went to the purchase history tab and would download one by one. You aren't able to download directly to an external drive unless the internal was full, so I let my internal drive fill up to force downloads to the external drive. After that, I would move my games from the internal to the external. This saved my drives from extra wear and tear.

Here is a list of what I bought before it was too late.

- Sniper: Ghost Warrior

- Cloudberry Kingdom

- Kane and Lynch: Dead Men

- Dark Messiah of Might and Magic

- Bionic Commando

Aside from games, I also downloaded all free game trailers and apps that interested me. This can be seen as a big waste of time because all the trailers have been uploaded to youtube and almost all the apps don't work anymore. Still, watching the Minecraft announcement trailer hits different when it is viewed on an actual 360.
